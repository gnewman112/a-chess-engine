## Introduction

'a-chess-engine' is a personal project to improve my Python skills, and test a ideas for evaluating chess positions. To play a game run main.py

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. The code here represents the outcome of time after work for 2 weeks.

My current focus is on improving speed and accuracy for moves. Both of these primarily involve improvements to the method 'Node.score_move()'. Also, about an hour ago I implemented the shelve module for persistent storage of scores, and evaluation times have increased 4x (this ought to be fixed by the next update).

## Suggestions / Improvements

If anyone who has made it here has any suggestions or improvements, please email the to me at ContactGregNewman@gmail.com
